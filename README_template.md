## 🔍 About The Project

### 🎯 The goal

On this section you can explain what's the problem behind this project. For example:

My projects READMEs were inconsistent in style and structure, making them harder to maintain and navigate, so I created this template.

### ⚙️ How it works?

Here you can explain how the project works, how it is structured, etc. For example:

To solve the problem I created this README template with placeholders in the form of [VAR]. These placeholders can easily be replaced, and the template includes all the sections I typically need for any project. If a section isn't relevant, it can simply be removed.

### 🎬 Demo

Here you can show some images and/or videos of the project. If just one demo image is enough, you may want to use the Project Media above, and delete this section.

### 🧩 Features
